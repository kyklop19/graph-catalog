    """Returns a minimum spanning tree of the connected graph as `EdgeList`

    This function is implemented as BorÅ¯vka's algorithm. It takes all
    vertices of the graph as a new graph. Until the new graph is connected for
    each component it adds edge with the lowest weight that connects two
    different components to the new graph.

    Args:
        graph (EdgeList): **Connected** graph as `EdgeList` with **numerically weighted edges**
        weight_name (str, optional): Name of edge weight that has numerical value. Defaults to "length".

    Returns:
        EdgeList: Minimum spanning tree of the graph as `EdgeList`
